The final version of the open source Otrera project should include the following:

	- A fully functioning RPG combat and level progression system
	- A rich variety of sample content including character classes, skills, and equipment
	- A basic suite of analytics services to gauge game balance
	- The ability to quickly generate and test new skills, classes, and complete games
	- High quality, tested code with complete documentation

The Otrera WebApp, which will include paid features, should do the following:

	Users can change attribute and stat names
	Users can define their own classes
	Users can define weapons, armor, equipment
	Users can get statistics on combat efficacy for balancing
	Users can define enemies
	Users can print out character sheets and game manuals
	Users can host games and scenarios for private use / kickstarter / whatever
