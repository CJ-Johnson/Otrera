Otrera
=========

Otrera is an open source role-playing game system. It
began as a toolkit for the "Daughtersof Ares" table top RPG 
(still under development) and evolved into a bigger and more
general RPG engine. Otrera was the mother of Hippolyta,
Antiope, Penthesilea, and Melanippe, thus the her name suits
the project that is the foundation of the original game.

Otrera provides the following tools:

1. Set of core rules and stat systems that can be copied
or adapated into original games for personal or commercial use.

2. Character builder tools to test out different classes and
builds and simulate level progression.

3. Comprehensive documentation (In Development)

4. Sample content (classes, skills, equipment, etc.) that
can also be copied or adapted.

5. Analytical tools to help balance your game. (In Development)

6. The ability to publish character / skill / story / equipment
sheets and full game manuals. (In Development)

Otrera is designed to be both simple and complex. You can 
use the docs to put together a simple pen and paperadventure,
or use the software to power a computer game. Building skills 
and equipment on top of the game engine is very straightforward. 
Your only limit should be your imagination.
