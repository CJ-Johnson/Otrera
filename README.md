Otrera is an open source role-playing game development system. 
It began as a toolkit for another RPG before evoling into a
general purpose engine and engine builder. It is named after
the Amazon Matriarch and concubine of Ares who plays a key
role in the "Daughters of Ares" books and games (still in
development) which inspired the creation of this software.

Otrera operates with two axioms:

I. Engines are sets of rules and systems, while games are
subsets of engines.

II. Your RPG will have characters.

Otrera provides the following tools:

1. Full-fledged engine builder to allow for the creation of
original character development and combat systems. Users can
then publish, modify, and patent their unique game systems.

2. Character builder and content editing tools. Users can
upload spreadsheets to quickly add hundreds of content items.

3. A number of default engines (including Pathfinder) which can
serve as the basis of new games and campaigns.

4. A wealth of sample content (classes, skills, equipment, etc.) 
that can also be copied or adapted.

5. Analytical tools to help balance your game. (In Development)

The goal of Otrera is to help table top RPG and board game makers
to create rich, complex, and balanced game systems. Whether you
want to make a simple one-off adventure on top of the default
engine or whether you want to create a completely original
system from scratch - Otrera will let you focus on your ideas and
content while handling the difficult mathematical challenges.

Building games with Otrera is easy. Your only limit should be
your imagination.
