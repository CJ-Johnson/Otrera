Mythology
=========

Mythology is an open source role-playing game system. It
was developed originally for the "Daughters of Ares"
Tabletop RPG.

Mythology consists of a set of core rules and stat systems.
These can easily be adapted into original RPG's for personal
or private use. The software modules are all in Python and
JSON, making them fairly easy to develop. There are also
a set of docs that lay out the entire game system.

Mythology is designed to be both simple and complex. You
can use the docs to put together a simple pen and paper
adventure, or use the software to power a computer game.
Building skills and equipment on top of the game engine
is very straightforward. Your only limit should be your
imagination.

Mythology does not include the specific skills or equipment
from the Daughters of Ares game; those elements, as well as
the scenario and other story elements remain under the
author's copyright.
