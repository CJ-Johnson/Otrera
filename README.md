Otrera is an open source role-playing game development system. 
It began as a toolkit for another RPG before evoling into a
general purpose engine and engine builder. It is named after
the Amazon Matriarch and concubine of Ares who plays a key
role in the "Daughters of Ares" books and games (still in
development) which inspired the creation of this software.

Otrera provides the following tools:

1. Set of core rules and stat systems that can be copied
or adapated into original games for personal or commercial use.

2. Character builder tools to test out different classes and
builds and simulate level progression.

3. Comprehensive documentation (In Development)

4. Sample content (classes, skills, equipment, etc.) that
can also be copied or adapted.

5. Analytical tools to help balance your game. (In Development)

6. The ability to publish character / skill / story / equipment
sheets and full game manuals. (In Development)

7. Full-fledged engine builder to allow for creation of original
combat and character development systems.

The goal of Otrera is to help table top RPG and board game makers
to create rich, complex, and balanced game systems. Whether you
want to make a simple one-off adventure on top of the default
engine or whether you want to create a completely original
system from scratch - Otrera will let you focus on your ideas and
content while handling the difficult mathematical challenges.

Building games with Otrera is easy. Your only limit should be
your imagination.
